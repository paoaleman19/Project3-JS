# Project3-JS

## Project 3 using Java Script

## JsontoMongoDB

The code first imports the required modules: `csv`, `json`, `MongoClient`, `pprint`, and `pandas`. It then sets the file paths for the `CSV` and `JSON` files.

Next, the CSV file is read using the DictReader method and converted into a list of dictionaries called "data". This list is then written to a JSON file with indentation using the dump method of the json module.
