# style.css

This CSS code specifies how the HTML elements of an HTML page should be styled. The meaning of each style rule is somewhat explained in the code's comments.

The code changes the font family to Arial or a sans-serif font and the background color of the body element to a dark gray hue (#333333). Additionally, it changes the font color for all elements to white.

The h1 element is centered on the page, with a font size of 36px, and a margin-top of 50px. White text is used in the ".subtitle" class.

The "#fetch-button" element is styled as a white button with green text that is rounded at the corners and has padding of 10 pixels on the top and bottom and 20 pixels on the left and right. Additionally, it contains a hover effect that turns the background greener.
