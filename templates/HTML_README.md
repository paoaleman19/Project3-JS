# HTML

The code is an HTML document that creates a webpage. It includes a title, a brief introduction, and a list of items that are part of a dataset. The webpage also contains three div elements that will display a bar chart, a pie chart, and a scatter plot respectively. The page also includes a button and a script that will fetch data and render the charts when clicked. The stylesheet "style.css" is also linked to the HTML page.
